# P2
Model of a cross flow plate heat exhanger.

The program is as simple as defining your parameters in the "if name == main"
and then running the program, the simulation is pretty fast, but be patient with the processing
of the video's specifically.
In this project there are already some pre made simulations,
so you don't have to run it.
